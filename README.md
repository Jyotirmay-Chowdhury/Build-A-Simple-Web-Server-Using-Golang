 Build A Simple Web Server using Golang


Install Go: Download and install Go from the official Go website (https://go.dev/) according to your operating system's instructions.

Create a new directory: Set up a new directory for your Go project.

Initialize a Go module: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and run the command go mod init your-module-name to initialize a Go module. Replace "your-module-name" with the desired name for your module.

Import required packages: Import the necessary packages in your Go code. You'll need the "fmt," "log," and "net/http" packages.

Define a handler function: Create a function that will handle incoming HTTP requests. The handler function should accept an http.ResponseWriter and an http.Request as parameters.

Implement the handler logic: Inside the handler function, define the logic to handle the incoming request. This can include processing the request, generating a response, and writing it to the http.ResponseWriter.

Register the handler: In the main function, use the http.HandleFunc() method to register your handler function for a specific path or URL pattern. This ensures that the handler function is invoked when a request matches the registered path.

Start the server: Use the http.ListenAndServe() function in the main function to start the web server. Specify the desired network address (e.g., ":8080") on which the server should listen for incoming requests.

Test the server: Open a web browser and visit the URL or path you registered in your handler function. Verify that the server responds with the expected output.
